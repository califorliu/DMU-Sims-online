## Note on renderer compatability issues and running on Linux:

If the sim fails to launch or consistently crashes, it is usually a rendering issue. The sim by default runs on DX12 but you can run it on Vulkan through cmd line arguments.

For Windows users: Shift+Right click anywhere inside the folder containing dmu-sim.exe > Open PowerShell window here > Enter `./dmu-sim.exe --rendering-driver vulkan`

The same arguments should also work for Linux users running it through Wine.

Alternative for Linux Users: you can download the Linux version of the Godot engine (any 4.7 version should work). Extract the `godot_..._linux.x86_64` file and rename it to `dmu-sim` and run it in the dmu-sim folder.

If you're on a laptop with integrated GPU and neither DX12 or Vulkan works, you can also try replacing `vulkan` with `opengl3`, though you will see a big drop in performance.


If you have any questions or feedback let me know on discord.
